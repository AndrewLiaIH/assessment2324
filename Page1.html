        <h2>Natural Therapy:</h2>
        <p>Firstly, living in or near the forest is proven to keep your brain in a healthier state (<a href="https://www.mpg.de/11548547/living-near-a-forest-keeps-your-amygdala-healthier" target="_blank" class="text-link">a report on this topic</a>). Those who live in a city have a higher chance of developing some 
          mental disorders and an overworked amygdala. On the other hand, those who live in a city 
          but also near a forest were <em>less</em> likely to develop those mental disorders, and were proven 
          to deal better with stress.

        <h2>Free and healthy air freshener:</h2>
        <p>Secondly, living near a forest provides you with fresher and healthier air. While this might 
          sound like a clich√©, it is a lot more than that. Fresh air boosts our immune systems, since 
          we breathe in the natural chemicals that plants release to defend themselves (<a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/90720.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">an article about this</a>). The same website claims that living near a forest also lowers your 
          blood pressure, improves your mood, increases your ability to focus, accelerates recovery
          time, increases energy level, and improves your sleep.

        <h2>Beautiful surroundings:</h2>
        <p>Finally, Haarlemmerhoutkwartier has many walking paths through the forest and park that
          can be great for family recreation, including your family members on 4 paws. They are well
          maintained, but also make you forget that you are in the middle of the city. There is also a 
          farm with sheep, deer, llamas, and other animals that are all visible over a fence that is short 
          enough for people of all heights and ages to see. Around that farm is a completely accessible
          walking path that also leads to more paths through the forest. In some fields, people meet
          with their dogs in the morning and let them socialize, run and have fun.
