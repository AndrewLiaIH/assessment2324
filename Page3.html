      <h1>The decision</h1>
      <section class="page3-text">
        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <p>Haarlemmerhoutkwartier is a beautiful district, and hopefully the pictures have shown you that. 
          There are plenty of forests and parks and refreshingly green areas to enjoy time outdoors alone, or with
          family or friends. The wonderful part is that you have access to all of that while still being in the 
          city.

      <section class="page3-text">
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <p>At the same time, there is a price tag on all of this, and a very large price tag at that. 
          Haarlemmerhoutkwartier will be unaffordable for most people. Another thing to consider is that the
          benefits of the area are not limited to just its inhabitants; you could live in another district and take a
          short walk to use the same amenities.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Haarlemmerhoutkwartier area is very beautiful and an attractive place to move to. There are
          large and healthy forests and parks that are integrated into this part of the city, but that is also
          reflected in the cost and availability of housing. Overall, there are many pros and cons to moving
          here, and I hope this website made your decision a little easier! If you have any questions or want 
          send us something, go to the contact page by clicking the appropriately named arrow. Otherwise, enjoy the
