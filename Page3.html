      <h1>The decision</h1>
      <section class="page3-text">
        <h2>Pros:</h2>
        <p>Haarlemerhoutkwartier is a beautiful district, and hopefully the pictures
          have shown you that. There are plenty of forests and parks and healthy 
          areas to enjoy time outdoors alone, or with family or friends. The 
          wonderful part is that you have access to all of that while still being in the city.
        </p>

      <section class="page3-text">
        <h2>Cons:</h2>
        <p>At the same time, there is a price tag on all of this, and a very large price tag 
         at that. Haarlemerhoutkwartier will be unaffordable for most people. And the
         benefits of the area are not limited to just its inhabitants; you could live in
          another district and take a short walk to use the same amenities.

      <section class="page3-text">
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>The Haarlemmerhoutkwartier area is very beautiful and an attractive place to move to. 
          There are large and healthy forests and parks that are integrated into this part of the 
          city, but that is also reflected in the cost and availability of housing. Overall, there
          are many pros and cons to moving here, and I hope this website made your decision a little easier!
